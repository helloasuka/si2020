          <h4>Philosophical Exorcism with Prototypes</h4>
          <p>The different calls for critical, speculative, more-than-human, but also participatory and open design force us to include the philosophical questions of the subject, consciousness, agency, but also society in prototyping. Prototypes become forms of philosophical inquiry that explore novel functions beyond user, human-centred, UX, and interaction design. These material and conceptual engagements “exorcise” the technologies and their complex genealogies, including the present political and social contexts, and invite us to think of design as future- and world-making. All philosophical concepts, such as idea, substance, consciousness, object, sign, or phenomenon were once prototypes that supported novel ways of thinking, communicating, and ultimately interacting with the world. To explore the various ways of combining design with philosophy, we will read Ovid's Metamorphoses as IoT scenarios, etch Renaissance prints as circuits, and make social networks based on Aristotle's theory of friendship. We prototype Nietzsche's hammer, Heidegger's pitcher, the strange clocks in Descartes and Leibniz, but also Neurath's boat. Should we read the Hegelian "owl of Minerva" and Kantian "light dove" as biohacking and husbandry proposals? Should we transform the numerous architectural visions of Popper's "bold structure" above swamp piles and Kant's "island of truth" into urban design proposals? </p>

          </h3>
          <h4>Platforms, networks, and impact of open, distributed and collaborative design and making processes</h4>
          <p>The integration of open source and peer-to-peer systems with the design practice and research has generated many changes and opportunities for developing new kinds of projects. An important example in this direction can be found in the distributed networks of collaborative design and making, especially present in the Maker Movement and in Open Design projects. This presentation will explain to them, and especially how they are supported by digital platforms, how new networks are created from them, and how we can understand the impact of all these new actors and phenomena.</p>
